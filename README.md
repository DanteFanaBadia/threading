## Design Constraints

- [*] You have the freedom to place the traffic lights at the points where the desired flow is resolved.
- [*] You have a budget to purchase a maximum of four traffic lights.
- [*] You must check that there are no collisions in the traffic flow.
- [*] You must animate your simulator with black arrows or car figures, giving the sensation of a real flow based on the traffic lights (red, green, yellow).
- [*] You must control the speed of the simulation with three options for the user:
     - Fast Simulation.
     - Intermediate Simulation
     - Slow Simulation.
- [*] The speed of each option must be parameterizable, and the user can adjust the seconds they want for each option (fast, intermediate or slow).
- [*] Consider enabling an option to reset the speed to default values.
- [*] The visual design of your program is free, but it must respond to the flow shown in the previous diagram.
